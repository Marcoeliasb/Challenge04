# Challenge04
The fourth challenge of the bootcamp

In this activity, I created a simple two-page website for a personal blog. The website allows users to input their blog posts and view them on another page. Here's a summary of what was done:

Additions:

Two HTML files were added: index.html for the landing page and index1.html for displaying blog posts.
Two JavaScript files were added: script.js for handling form submission and redirecting, script1.js for dynamically rendering blog posts
Three CSS files were added: style.css for general styling
Modifications:

In index.html, a form was added for users to input their username, blog title, and content.
In script.js, the form submission event listener was added to handle form submission, store blog post data in localStorage, and redirect to the blog page.
In script1.js, code was added to dynamically render blog posts from localStorage onto the blog page.
Styling was added or modified in the CSS files to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the website.
Why:
The additions and modifications were made to fulfill the user stories and acceptance criteria specified for the project. These changes allow users to interact with the website by submitting blog posts, viewing them on a separate page, and toggling between light and dark modes for better readability. The separation of concerns into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files helps maintain a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain the website.
